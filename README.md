### Welcome to my first attempt to make a Virtual Reality game. It is a basicly a game of shooting hoops.


# Updates

I am trying to update this game on a least 2-3 day basis, i am really excited to learn how to make VR games so hopefully that will push me to finish this ASAP.

The core game is mostly ready, i just need to fix the lighting, sounds, help with testing and setting it up on multiple VR devices.

# about the game
Shoot Hoop is supposed to be a first person basketball game available on PC and VR devices. Your shot attempts are counted and your points are added up and you are timed. Created by Mohammed Jaludi.

# How to play

Controlls are simple: Mouse (or headset) controlls field of view and aim direction. Left mouse button shoots the ball.

# Installation

Download The contents of the latest version folder ( .exe and .dat files) and have fun!
